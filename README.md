# 🛍️ Black Friday Sales Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts customer purchase amounts using the Black Friday dataset from a retail company.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
To understand consumer behavior and predict purchase amounts based on features like age, gender, occupation, city, and product categories.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Linear Regression

## 📁 Files
- `Black_friday_sales` – Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and modeling.
- `train.csv` – Dataset
- 'test.csv' – Dataset
- `README.md` – This file.

## 📈 Summary
- Performed data cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing.
- Used linear regression to predict purchase amounts.
- Evaluated model with MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.

## 🧠 Result
- R² Score: ~0.15
- Mean Absolute Error: ~3524

## 📌 Improvements
- Try more complex models like RandomForest or XGBoost
- Feature engineering (combine or transform features)
